Description: 
        This is an interface to read() and write() on a direct I/O context (O_DIRECT flag) from the Python programming language.
        
        These system calls are Linux system calls to read or write from the file ignores the buffer cache.
        
        The O_DIRECT flag introduced in SGI IRIX, where it has alignment restrictions similar to those of Linux 2.4. 
        FreeBSD 4.x introduced a flag of the same name, but without alignment restrictions. 
        Support was added under Linux in kernel version 2.4.10. Older Linux kernels simply ignore this flag.
